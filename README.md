# Capture of causal genetic mechanisms by machine learning methods for predicting bacterial traits based on genetic variation

Our research sought to assess the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms in pinpointing causal genetic mechanisms by simulating quantitative phenotypes using actual genomic sequencing data from Klebsiella pneumoniae samples. We varied the number of causal loci and the sizes of their effects to gauge the accuracy of four widely employed ML models: elastic nets, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks.

## Description

This Python script demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques using libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow.keras`, and `pandas` for phenotype prediction. The models included are Elastic Net, XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Keras-based neural network model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib (optional, for future extensions)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Place your `.phen` and `.Rtab` files in the specified directory structure.
2. Modify the `path` variable in the script to match your directory structure.
3. Run the script using the following command, optionally passing arguments for `outfile` and `length`.

```bash
python your_script_name.py [outfile] [length]
```

- `outfile`: Name of the output file without the extension.
- `length`: An integer that divides the number of features.
