# Capture of causal genetic mechanisms by machine learning methods for predicting bacterial traits based on genetic variation

Our research sought to assess the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms in pinpointing causal genetic mechanisms by simulating quantitative phenotypes using actual genomic sequencing data from Klebsiella pneumoniae samples. We varied the number of causal loci and the sizes of their effects to gauge the accuracy of four widely employed ML models: elastic nets, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks.
